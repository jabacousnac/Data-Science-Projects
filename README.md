These are side projects that (usually) have nothing to do with physics

...So far...

1) approval_ratings predicts presidential approval ratings from socio-economic indicators. Lots of data wrangling here because I scrapped data from so many different sources

2) customer_churn predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a bank or not, based on customer data. Very strong model (99% accuracy) using logistic regression. One predictor was very strong, and I deemed it to be a "cheating" predictor. Without it accuracy falls to 80%. Can improve upon it with gradient boosting -- we go all the way up to 86%
